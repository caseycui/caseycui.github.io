My name is Qiujie (QJ), A machine learning engineer, roboticist, and tech enthusiast passionate about building smarter, more intuitive robotsâ€”especially for the kitchen and home. My research interests lie in developing algorithms that enable robots to learn from interaction, acquire perception and manipulation skills, and collaborate seamlessly with humans in real-world, long-horizon tasks.</p> <p>Besides robotics, I like to stay active, explore the great outdoors, travel, draw inspiration from nature, cultural experiences, and food, and learn something new about this big, beautiful world.</p> </body></html>
