Collected training and validation data with drone filming person of interest walking in a crowd with different backgrounds in the Unity simulation environment

Designed and trained neural network (depth of 4 encoder/decoder layers and 1x1 convolution layer) for semantic segmentation â€“ to parse a test image and identify the target, crowd and background in the image pixels for drone to follow the target.
